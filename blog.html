            <article>
               <p>For a long time when designing websites developers usually used the pixle units which is very simple to undersand.
                   But there is a disadvantage  to using it.The relative units usually expressed in rem,em and % are relative meaning the are size measuring units relative to something.
                   The difference between them is what they actually are relative to. They all are relative to font-sizes but
                    rem is always relative to the root element,the html which is 16px by default while em units and % are relative to the parent element.
                    so considering the browsers zoom capablity what is great about using these relative size is that the user can actually control the size of the font from their browser's settings. so if a user goes to 
                     the browser's setting and changes its font size to a smaller or larger scale every thng is still readeable.But had the developer used the pixle units
                    whether you change  the browser's font size or not it will stay intact.  </p>

            <article>
                <p>when we set 200px to some element the browser interprets it as 200px itself.so it will override the default pixle size that is 16.And no matter how we resize our browser whether we shrink it or not the element will still be 200px beacause pixle is an absolute unit.</p>

            <article>
                <p>When talking about its compatablity css3 is backward compatible with css1.
                     It will not make any code written in css1 invalid. After css3 has been 
                     introduced rounded corners and gradients become easy. The developer just 
                     needs to write the code like “.roundBorder {border radius: 1px ;}”.The user need not
                      place the code on the server and perform the other activities. The gradient can be used
                       by using code like “.grad.BG {background: linear-gradient (white, black) ;}”.
                       when it comes to animation and text effect before css3 was launched it was launched
                        it was written in JavaScript and JQuery. Now a developer can add text shadows to make 
                        it easier to read. They can also add visual effects to break lines and longer words so
                         that they fit properly inside the columns and word wraps. Pseudo-classes in css3 are
                          pretty similar to css but there are some additional features :- root target which 
                          documents root element, nth-child (n) uses numeric values within (n) to target child 
                          elements with respect to their position in the parent and empty target elements that
                           do not have text or children like elements such as empty paragraph tag.</p>.
